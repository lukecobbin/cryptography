Encrypt and Decrypt files.
This repository contains two python scripts. One is for encrypting all the files in a driectory (encrypt.py) 
and the other is for decrypting those files (decrypt.py)

They are fairly basic, mostly to demonstrate simple encrytion and decryption but they could be modified to do more.

Caesar Cipher
caesar.py is python code for decrypting caesar ciphers.
It takes arguments from the caommand line and shows all 26 version of the caesar cipher
Example: python3 caesar.py JxyiYiXemJeKiuYj
